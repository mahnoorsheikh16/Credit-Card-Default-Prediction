# Credit Card Default Prediction
This classification problem aims to predict whether a customer will default on next month's credit card payment using a [UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).

Access the [streamlit](https://fds-project-cmse830-credit-card-default-prediction-r2f68jop9pe.streamlit.app/) web app to explore the insights derived from the analysis.

## Introduction:
Credit risk refers to the cardholder's inability to make required payments on their credit card debt, leading to 'credit default.' This poses a major concern for financial institutions, as defaults can result in significant losses and, in severe cases, even bankruptcy. Conducting thorough evaluations and verifying a borrower's ability to repay can help prevent the over-issuance of credit cards to unqualified applicants, thereby minimizing credit risk.

Machine learning models can be deployed to identify risky customers and minimise lenders' losses. By using algorithms to study historical transactions and customer demographics, we can apply the findings to future customers, effectively distinguishing between risky and non-risky profiles. This approach leads to more efficient loan lending practices.

## Environment
The analysis has been conducted in Python and the source code requires the following libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `scipy`, and `imblearn`.

Primary libraries used for visualizations are `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `hiplot`.

`streamlit` must be installed to run the `streamlit_code.py` file. Run it using the following command in the terminal:
```
streamlit run streamlit_code.py
```

## Datasets:
**I. Default of Credit Card Clients**

Dataset contains information on credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. It has 30,000 instances across 25 attributes, contains multivariate characteristics, and the attributes have both integer, categorical and real data types. The attribute summary is as follows:

`AGE`: Age in years

`PAY_0`: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)

`PAY_2`: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)

`PAY_3`: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)

`PAY_4`: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)

`PAY_5`: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)

`PAY_6`: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)

`BILL_AMT1`: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

`BILL_AMT5`: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

`BILL_AMT6`: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

`PAY_AMT1`: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

`PAY_AMT2`: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

`PAY_AMT3`: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

`PAY_AMT4`: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
