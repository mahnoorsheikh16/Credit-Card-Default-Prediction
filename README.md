# Credit Card Default Prediction
This classification problem aims to predict whether a customer will default on next month's credit card payment using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost Classifier.

Access the [streamlit](https://credit-card-default-prediction-msu-cmse830.streamlit.app/) web app to delve into the detailed steps of data cleaning, preprocessing, modelling, and time series forecasting, as well as to uncover the insights derived from the analysis.

## Introduction:
Credit risk refers to the cardholder's inability to make required payments on their credit card debt, leading to 'credit default.' This poses a major concern for financial institutions, as defaults can result in significant losses and, in severe cases, even bankruptcy. Conducting thorough evaluations and verifying a borrower's ability to repay can help prevent the over-issuance of credit cards to unqualified applicants, thereby minimizing credit risk.

Machine learning models can be deployed to identify risky customers and minimise lenders' losses. By using algorithms to study historical transactions and customer demographics, we can apply the findings to future customers, effectively distinguishing between risky and non-risky profiles. This approach leads to more efficient loan lending practices.

## Environment
The analysis has been conducted in Python and the source code requires the following libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `scipy`, and `imblearn`.

Primary libraries used for visualizations are `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, and `hiplot`.

`streamlit` must be installed to run the `streamlit_code.py` file. Run it using the following command in the terminal:
```
streamlit run streamlit_code.py
```

## Datasets:
